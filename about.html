                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>Hey there!</p>
                    <p>I’m Cat. The Founder of The Content Catalogz. Also known as a Freelancer Marketer who focuses on analytics, strategy, and user behaviour.</p>
                    <p>I grew up hearing “dream big” but as soon as I did, I was called unrealistic. Told to be more realistic with my goals in life. But that’s never been me.</p>
                    <p>I came up with The Content Catalogz on a random Monday night when I was 48 tabs deep in my dissertation research.</p>
                    <p>Studying Business for a total of 8 years made me realise one thing: I wanted to be my own boss and run my own business. Over the years, I went through countless business ideas and ended up hating all of them. Until it clicked. I studied Business and Sociology during my A-Level years and always had an interest in the Sociological/Psychological factors of how we work and why we do certain things.</p>
                    <p>Marketing is exactly that.</p>
                    <p>It’s made up of scientifically curated algorithms that collect all of your data from your social platforms to create a feed that will keep you engaged and scrolling to your doom because your attention is currency and YOU are the product.</p>
                    <p>My mission sounds simple, but it certainly isn’t.</p>
                    <p>I believe that when it comes to Marketing, it’s a case of the Consumer VS the Marketing. I want consumers to become more aware of the tactics used across social platforms and marketing, and make more conscious, informed decisions. I want marketers to be more aware of the tactics they are implementing, the impact this can have on consumers, and be more ethical in their practices.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to help both sides make better decisions, but I also want to help businesses and creators reach their targets and grow their socials.</p>
                    <p>My promise to you, is to continue to learn, research, and develop strategies which are ethical, are tailored to your business needs, and help you reach your targets.</p>
                    <p>And no, I can’t make you go viral overnight, but I can help you implement strategies by analysing your content, social pages, and analytics.</p>
